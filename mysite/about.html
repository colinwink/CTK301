    <p> Hello! My name is Colin Winkelmann, and I am a junior at Illinois State University. I am studying <a href="https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/creative-technologies-interdisciplinary/"> Creative Technologies </a>, and I'm enjoying every minute of it! I study Web Development, Audio Engineering, Video, and Game Development. It's all things I have always had an interest in. I grew up always using the computer and would spend my time editing gaming videos on Windows Movie Maker. I also made action films that I recorded on my iPod and uploaded them to Youtube. I also used to write songs on Garageband on my family iPad. As you can see, Creative Technologies is exactly the place I want to be. </p>
		<p> My favorite thing to do is compose music digitally. I use FL Studio to create rap beats, ambient pieces, and other electronic songs. During my sophomore year, I wrote the soundtrack (along with a few others) to a game that was developed by the <a href="https://redbirdlife.illinoisstate.edu/organization/gdc">Game Design Team.</a> You can hear the OST for the 2020 Club's Game, Ground Zero, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-413212540/sets/ground-zero-illinois-state?si=a5c60285c66b4c81b95fc75b44292603">here.</a> </p>
